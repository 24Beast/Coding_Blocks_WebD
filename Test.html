            Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds.<br> Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.” That was the only time I ever heard<br> Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. “Your father’s right,” she said. <br>“Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs,<br> they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.</p>

            We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it because otherwise we <br>can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable:<br> we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change.<br> The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us.<br> We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it,<br> led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.</p>

            I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.<br> I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
